> Software for running a connected alarm clock on a Raspberry Pi.

This is a WIP project for personal use but its motivation is for giving a tech talk on using my companies stack to build an alarm clock that uses weather data to wake me up in the mornings.

## Plan

- Clock
- Alarm(s)
    - Fallback alarm (dip switch)
    - Automated alarms based around goals
- 7-segment LED display for time
- Eink display for info
- Way to update code
- Spotify play
